# Secure-Pass
The project is for learning and under development and hence should not be used to store passwords in the present form.
This will include codes related with storing usernames and passwords in a secure way.

# To do
Add the code for the passwords and the passphrse to be meeting some parameters such as having atleast one integer, special characters, minimum length etc..

Make some form of documentation so that it follows the systems engineering model, this means to add documents such as requirements,..

Options to store multiple users, service and password pairs using arrays, database etc.

Having a user interface to interact with the code

Having the option to define administrators users etc with various privilages for storing and retrieving the passwords

Option to define pairs of passphrases (more than two people storing different passphrase for the same data and make the password be retrievable only with the all the people entering their passphrase)

Using the concept of block chain to store the data in such a way that the data of individuals is stored using the hashing power of the network

Encrypting the databse file itself
