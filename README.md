# Secure-Pass
The project is for learning and is under development.
This will include codes related with storing usernames and passwords in a secure way.
## Note: if you store a password with some range and then try to retrieve the password from a range which does not fall within the original range then the passwords can't be retrieved. If you don't remember the range, you can try with some big range say 100000 to 200000 to retrieve the passwords. bigger numbers are defined so that it takes more time for some one else to retrieve the password provided he also knows the passphrase.

## To do
Add the code for the passwords and the passphrse to be meeting some parameters such as having atleast one integer, special characters, minimum length etc..

Make some form of documentation so that it follows the systems engineering model, this means to add documents such as requirements,specifications..

Options to store multiple users, service and password pairs using arrays, database etc.

Having a user interface to interact with the code and store and retrieve passwords.

Having the option to define administrators, users etc with various privileges for storing and retrieving the passwords

Option to define pairs of passphrases (more than two people storing different passphrase for the same data and make the password be retrievable only with the all the people entering their passphrase)

Using the concept of block chain to store the data in such a way that the data of individuals is stored using the hashing power of the network

Encrypting the databse file itself
