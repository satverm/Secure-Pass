# Secure-Pass
# The project is for learning and is under development.
This will include codes related with storing usernames and passwords in a secure way.
## Note: if you store a password with some range specified at the beginning of the code and then try to retrieve the password from a range which does not fall within the original range then the passwords can't be retrieved. If you don't remember the range, you can try with some big range say 100000 to 200000 to retrieve the passwords. Bigger numbers are defined so that it takes more time for some one else to retrieve the password provided he also knows the passphrase.

## Updates: 
Full terminal/Text based UI completed.
## Smart Secure: Secure the password by making the lim_min and lim_max variable very large and a difference of atleast 10,000 between them (for example 800000 and 810000) and then revert the code to the default value of 1000 and 2000.
## To do: Moved to ToDo.org file.
